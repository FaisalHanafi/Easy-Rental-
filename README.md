## Easy Rental
Vehicle Rental Management System

# Introduction
A project for the CSC 1103 class on object-oriented programming was done by me (Faisal).
A simple registration system for Easy Rental Ltd. is developed using Java.
utilises several key concepts of OOP, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and several more.

# Intsruction
1) First things first, you will need to enter several aspects of your biodata, such as your name, matriculation number, IC or passport number, vehicle licence number, and last but not least, your phone number.
2) The reason behind the need for a matriculation number is that the system is built to cater to International Islamic University Malaysia students.
3) Then, choose between the type of vehicle offered (a car or a motorcycle).
4) Next, choose between the different models of vehicle that are preferred.
5) Different models of the same vehicle type will cost differently.
5) Then, choose the amount of rental time.
Next, choose whether you are a member or not.
7) Members of Easy Rental will receive a certain amount of discounts.
8) Then, the system will calculate the total charges, which will include goods-and-services tax (GST), which amounts to 6%.
5) The system will ask the user to input the amount for the payment.
6) Lastly, the system will produce a receipt for the whole transaction.


# Future
Add a better payment module.
